# 🚀 CIT300 – Algorithm Performance Analyzer  
### Graded Practical Assignment 3 | Week 14  
**Repository:** [AlgorithmExecutionTimeMeasurement](https://github.com/Tharindu999-git/AlgorithmExecutionTimeMeasurement.git)  

This Java‑based project measures and compares the execution time of different algorithms when run on arrays of sizes **100**, **500**, and **1000**, using `System.nanoTime()` for timing.

## 🎯 Project Objective  

1. Generate random integer arrays for each size.  
2. Run each algorithm (search or sort) on those arrays.  
3. Measure the execution time using `System.nanoTime()`.  
4. Print the results in a clear table format so you can compare how time scales with input size.  

_Example Output Format_:
